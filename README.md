# Project Euler

This repository is for housing my solutions to the Project Euler problems.

## Installation

To install the repository, clone it locally and then run `yarn install`.

## Testing

I will be using TDD practices and working on 100% coverage of the functions used to solve the problems.

* `yarn test`: Test with coverage report.
* `yarn tdd`: Test that watches changes and updates. Leave this up when developing.
